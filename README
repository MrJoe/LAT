General Information
===================

lat stands for LDAP Administration Tool.  The tool allows you to browse
LDAP-based directories and add/edit/delete entries contained within.  It
can store profiles for quick access to different servers. 

There are also different views available such as Users, Groups and Hosts 
which allow you to easily manage objects without having to deal with the 
intricacies of LDAP.

lat is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, 
see the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The official web site is:

Installation
============

lat requires the following other packages:

	* Mono 1.1.8
	* Gtk# 1.9.5
	* GNOME Keyring 0.4.2

Simple installation procedure:

	# tar zxvf lat-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
	# cd lat-X.Y.Z
	# ./configure
	# make
	# make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

NOTE: LAT has two (2) pre-built assemblies included in the archive.  One
is gnome-keyring-sharp.dll and the other is a custom Novell.Directory.Ldap.dll.

The custom Novell.Directory.Ldap.dll contains a one line change to make
SSL support work.  I've filed a bug with Novell so that in the future,
I can just use the standard assembly that comes with Mono.  More
details at: 

http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1233&group_id=1318&atid=1362

If you don't wish to use these .dlls you can 'configure' that with the 
following options:

--enable-system-gnome-keyring

	Uses pkg-config to find the system installed copy of the 
	gnome-keyring-sharp.dll.

--enable-system-ldap

	Uses the standard Novell.Directory.Ldap.dll distributed with Mono.  
	Be aware that using this option will break SSL support in LAT!


Hacking

LAT is written in C# using Mono and Gtk#. The source code is available from
